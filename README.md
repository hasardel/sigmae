# SIGMAE
SIgnal Generating Modular Audio Engine


## Introduction

SIGMAE is an audio engine that is aimed to be used as a realtime sound engine
in many applications like modular synthetisers, game engines to render sounds
that fit to the player environnement (like parametizable explosions), or just
audio players. We also focus especially on supporting a wide range of formats
both for samples - througt the use of the Snd library - and sounds processing
and generating - like .csd, .ams, .pd. It is also designed to be as small and
fast as possible.


## Compilation / Requirements

You just have to type this (for the moment):
./make.sh
or:
./make.sh all

This library is designed, at this time, only for linux. Portage on other unix
environnements is probably quite easy - but will not be done until the engine
is fully achieved and stable.
